**AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS**

This is a relatively well-formatted "manuscript". That means it adheres to some really basic formatting and styles. it should be suitable for submission to agents or editors. That said, **you should double check your entire document** for any issues. In particular:

* Page numbering begins with the title page, you may want to change that.
* Any special styles (for example, the "text chain" paragraph style) may not look right. You should be sure to look through the document for those.
* Horizontal rules look different here than in the PDF or ePub! You may want to change them.
* **Be sure to delete these instructions!** You don't want to submit _these_ to your publisher.
